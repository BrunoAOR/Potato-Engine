TO DO list:

* Define Layers and z-index for Renderers

* Implement a Prefabs system. It could work through factory methods that could be written to create
	and setup a certain GameObject and then return a Reference<GameObject> just like the usual GameObject::createNew() function does.

* Review all engine classes and implement (or delete) copy constructors/assignments and move constructors/assignments
